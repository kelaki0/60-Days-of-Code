HTML, CSS and JS (JavaScript). Building 60 projects to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 50+ HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript projects.

# Git Setup
1. Install Git: Make sure you have Git installed on your machine. VS Code uses your local Git installation to perform all version control operations. You can download it from the official Git website.

2. Configure Git: The most important step for a seamless experience is to configure your Git user name and email. This information is attached to every commit you make. In your VS Code terminal, run the following commands, replacing the placeholders with your information:

      git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  
      git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  
This is a one-time setup that applies to all your repositories.

3. Authenticate with GitHub: VS Code will prompt you to sign in to your GitHub account when you first try to push or pull from a GitHub repository. This is usually handled by the built-in "GitHub" extension, which is included with VS Code. You will be redirected to your browser to authorize VS Code, and once you've done that, your credentials will be stored securely.
